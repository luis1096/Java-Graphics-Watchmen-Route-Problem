Assignment 3 for Computational Geometry 

This project aims at the development of skills by students in the use of computational geometry
algorithms and techniques. Students will be able to design, implement, and test a solution for a twodimensional orthogonal range search problem using concepts and tools studied in class. Students will be
exposed to some other tools in the areas of event-driven programming and Java graphics.

The watchman route problem is an optimization problem in computational geometry which consist of, 
given a polygonal area and set of polygonal obstacles in the area, compute the shortest route a 
watchman should take to guard the area. In this assignment you are asked to implement a solution to a 
variation of this problem: the watchman can only follow a number of fixed directions and to prevent 
predictability, the watchman must change direction often.
